#Available Console Commands


help
	-This provides a list of commands as well as instructions for using the system. 
	 It is currently outdated as was able to impliment a few more commands after classes in my spare time.

list_active 
	-This lists the Containers contained in the RunningList. Again, these are the containers 
	 visible in the game world and not in the factory. You can see where they are located and 
	 how many emitters they contain by a image I created


list_factory 
	-In the case you forget the names or the particles you've created, 
	 you can call this to display the names of the particles loaded from XML.

spawn/load 
	-This will take a container from the factory, duplicate it and insert it into the running containers.

activate/run
	-By default, containers remain dormant until told to begin running. 
	 You can have the container run as a whole, or call on a specific Emitter instead. 
	 (IE: I have Fire ready, but only want to see Sparks updating and rendering.)

deactivate/end
	-Same as above, but for deactivation. 

containerPosition/containerLocation/cloc/cpos
	-Changes to position of the emitter. This does NOT save to XML.

positionx/posx/positiony/posy/positionz/posz
	-Changes the starting position of the particles. 
	 Takes two numbers. Min and Max. 
	 A random position is made between them. This is emitter level only.

velocityx/velx/velocityy/vely/velocityz/velz
	-Same as position.

rate
	-Changes the spawn over X time rate.
	 Takes two numbers. Number/time

image/texture
	-Changes the texture of the container or emitter.
 	 If the spriteCountTotal, 
	 spriteCountX, and spriteCountY are given, the system assumes the particles are now animated.

life
	-Changes the lifespan of the particles.

color
	-changes the color of the particles:

export
	-Takes the name of the container and saves it as the new filename.

/ps image Fire Smoke snowflakeAnimated.png 8 4 2
	-Sets the "Smoke" emitters texture within "Fire" to an animated image with 8 total sprites. 4 columns, 2 rows


/ps rate Fire Smoke 1000 10
	-Change the "Smoke" emitter within "Fire" to emit 1000 particles evenly over 10 seconds


/ps export Fire NewFire
	Takes the "Fire" container(edited or not) and creates a new file "NewFire" with it's current data


/ps export Fire Fire
